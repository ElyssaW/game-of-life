# Conway's Game of Life

A WIP browser-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, made with Canvas.

## Rules

-    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
-    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
-    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
